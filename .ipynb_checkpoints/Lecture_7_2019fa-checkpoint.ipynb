For example, say you want to find the probability that a student will take the bus as opposed to walking to class today (A) given that it's snowing heavily outside (B). The probability that the student will take the bus when it's snowing is likely higher than the probability that s/he would take the bus on some other day. "

    "The goal of logistic regression is to take a set of datapoints and classify them. This means that we expect to have discrete outputs representing a set of classes. In simple logistic regression, this must be a binary set: our classes must be one of only two possible values. Here are some things that are sometimes modeled as binary classes:\n",

Given a training set X = x1, ..., xn with responses Y = y1, ..., yn, bagging repeatedly (B times) selects a random sample with replacement of the training set and fits trees to these samples:\n",
